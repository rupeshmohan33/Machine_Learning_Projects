# ISNAR Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This repository contains multiple machine learning models developed for the **ISNAR** project. The models include various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, ensemble techniques, and clustering approaches for predictive analysis.

## Models Included
### Supervised Learning Models
- **ISNAR_LOR.ipynb / LOR_ISNAR.ipynb** – Logistic Regression
- **ISNAR_SLR.ipynb** – Simple Linear Regression
- **MLR_ISNAR.ipynb** – Multiple Linear Regression
- **NB_ISNAR.ipynb** – Naïve Bayes
- **SVM_ISNAR.ipynb** – Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **RF_ISNAR.ipynb** – Random Forest Classifier
- **kNN_ISNAR.ipynb** – k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

### Ensemble Learning
- **ENSEMBLE_ISNAR.ipynb** – Ensemble Methods (Stacking, Bagging, Boosting)

### Clustering Models
- **KMEANS_ISNAR.ipynb** – K-Means Clustering
- **HC_and_DBSCAN.ipynb** – Hierarchical Clustering & DBSCAN

### Decision Tree Models
- **DECT_ISNAR.ipynb** – Decision Tree Classifier

## Implementation
Each notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing steps.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dependencies
To run the notebooks, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ISNAR-ML-Models.git
   ```
2. Open a Jupyter Notebook and run the desired model.

## Evaluation
- **Classification Models**: Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Regression Models**: Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.
- **Clustering Models**: Evaluated using Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
- Deploying models as an API.
